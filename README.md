# Task02_SystemC_Polynom
This is the Template for the 2nd Task.
The task consists of 3 Parts.
## Part a: Polynom Evaluation
Your task is to develop a module that calculates the value of a polynomial.
All files for this module are located in the subfolder ```polynom```.

The task consists of the following steps:
- Define your module inside the file ```poly.h```. The modules interface constists of an input for the polynomials argument. and an output for its value, both of type double.
- Develop the implementation of the module using one or more functions and place it in ```poly.cpp```.
- Integrate the module into the top level hierarchy located in ```main.cpp```.

The polynom is defined in the file ```poly.h``` with the degree of the polynom and its coefficients which are stored inside an array.
